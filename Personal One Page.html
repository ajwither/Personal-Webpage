	<h3>Why Did I Study Design?</h3>
	<p>I decided to study design because I like to create things. Specifically, I like to create videos. It is fun for me to come up with an idea and use my skills to help that idea come to life.</p>

	<h3>Do You Have A Cause You Care About?</h3>
<p>I can not think of a specific cause I am passionate about. I like it when things are fair, so if the cause is fair, I can support it.</p>

	<h3>What Aspect of Design is Your Favorite?</h3>
	<p>I mainly like the graphic design side of it. I like using Illustrator to make things. As said earlier, I also like creating videos.</p>

	<h3>Do You Have Work You'd Like To Share?</h3>
	<p>For one of my classes, I had to create a book cover for a story I had come up with. I am very proud of that work and think it is one of my best so far.</p>

	<h3>What Are Your Favorite Websites and Why?</h3>
<p>I do not know if this qualifies as a website, but I like informational websites that tell you all the information you are looking for without buffing up the piece. I also like articles.</p>

<h3>What Aesthetics Are You Drawn To?</h3>
<p>I like sleek and minimalistic designs, but I also like it when designs pop out and can have multiple focus points.</p>
